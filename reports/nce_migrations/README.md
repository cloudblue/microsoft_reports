# CSP-NCE Migrations Report

This template allows you to create a report containing NCE commercial subscriptions which has been transitioned from legacy CSP. You can create a report for a particular date, Microsoft NCE product, marketplace or environment. Each row of the report will have details of a NCE subscription which was transitioned from CSP. Additional details on how to configure this report can be found in the Distributor Portal Configuration Guide.

Please take into account the following:

- The report will only list those subscriptions in NCE which had been transition from CSP using CloudBlue CSP-NCE Migration Tool
- The report does not contain NCE subscriptions which had been transitioned from CSP using partner self-serve increment-decrement method

You can configure the report according to the following:

- Request creation date range.
- List of transaction types (test, production).
- List of marketplaces.
