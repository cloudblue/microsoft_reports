# CSP-NCE Migrations Report

This template allows you to create a report containing detailed information on the NCE Commercial subscriptions which have been transitioned from legacy CSP. Additional details on how to configure this report can be found in the Distributor Portal Configuration Guide.

Please take into account the following:

- The report will only list the NCE subscriptions that have been transitioned from CSP using the CloudBlue CSP-NCE Migration Tool.
- The report does not contain NCE subscriptions that were transitioned from CSP using the Partner Self-Serve Increment-Decrement method.

You can configure the report according to the following:

- Request creation date range
- List of transaction types (test, production)
- List of marketplaces
